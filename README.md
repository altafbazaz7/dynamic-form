The Form component accepts the following props:

fields: An array of objects specifying the form fields. Each object should contain the following properties:
inputType: Type of input field (e.g., text, email, radio, select, checkbox).
label: Label for the input field.
key: Unique key for identifying the field.
options (optional): An array of options for radio buttons or select dropdowns.
onSubmit: A function to handle form submission. It receives the form data as an argument.
Customization
You can customize the form by adding or modifying fields in the fields array. Simply add new objects to the array with the desired properties.

Validations
To implement field-specific validations, you can pass a validation function as a property in the field object. The validation function should return true if the input is valid and false otherwise.

Scalability and Modularity
The form component is designed to be scalable and modular. You can easily add or remove fields without disrupting the overall functionality. Each form element encapsulates its own validation logic, ensuring a clean and modular structure.

Performance Considerations
Optimizations have been implemented to ensure optimal performance, especially when dealing with a large number of fields. Techniques such as memoization and virtualization may be employed to enhance performance further.

Plug-and-Play Compatibility
The form component is designed for easy integration into any React project. It follows a plug-and-play approach, allowing seamless integration without intricate adjustments.

Conclusion
With this dynamic form component, you can easily create versatile forms for various purposes. Whether it's a simple contact form or a complex data entry form, the component provides flexibility and ease of use.
